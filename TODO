key to display help info on current mode, including list of supported commands; the 'help' txt for a command should be attached to the command's function/method, as an attribute

mode to see list of available scenarios, and pick one to play

user can save game

user can load game

game supports 2-N factions
    each faction can be controlled by either:
        hotseat human
        remote human (TCP, sockets, maybe use Twisted)
        AI (which runs inside the server process, wherever that is)

command to show a table of statistics about all factions, one line/chunk per faction

built-in editor mode
    lets user modify the map (terrain, cities, etc.)
    lets user add/delete/modify units in any cell
    can save to a scenario file
    can load from a scenario file

game has a client-server arrchitecture: one server process running on host machine, plus one client process per human player (there may be muultiple hotseat humans sitting at same computer sharing the same client process, taking turns; plus, zero or more remote human players or player groups, each with a single client process per computer, etc.)

minefield - when units move into the cell, they may suffer HP damage

fortified/fortress - defense bonus to units in that cell

way for user to create minefields and fortifieds/fortresses in a cell -- using an Engineer unit?

if city is surrounded (enemy units in all adj cells) then it's actual buildrate is reduced with regards to building new units; also, the buildrate it contributes to it's owning empire's unit support needs is cutoff to zero or merely reduced (if reduced, reduced more severely than is for local builds)

if support need vs. city support provide shortfall is too severe, it should start penalizing units in the field (reduced movement, reduced combat ability, etc.)

neutral units should move randomly during the neutral faction's turn
    the neutral faction's turn should be executed programmatically, first switch into a Mode that doesn't allow user input handling, then execute shit (move his units, attack with his units, etc.), then exit that mode goign back into a normal Mode

multiple different unit types
    a water-travelling type (ship)
    an aircraft
    a water transport that can load/unload land units, and carry loaded ones when it moves across water

some unit types can move across water, some can't

mountains may not be moved into by most land units (but some can)
    almost all air units can move into mountains

how to find out screen or current window max xy?
curses.getsyx?
from the Window isntance?


when city captured, partisans may be created nearby right then, and/or in subsequent turns, so long as the city remains foreign occupied/consquered (ie. owned by a faction which did not own it at scenario start)

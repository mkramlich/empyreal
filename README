README

Empyreal is an Empire-like game written in Python using curses for the UI.

It is under construction. Much work remains to be done, features to add, optimizations to perform, user conveniences and options to add, etc.

It is mostly an excuse to familiarize myself with Python's curses module, and to refamiliarize with curses in general.

The UI is currently designed with some assumptions that make it work best in a terminal whose minimum dimensions are 80 cols by 42 lines.
